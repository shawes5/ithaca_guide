## Why We Made This Guide?
We interviewed an international MBA student currently enrolled at Cornell who had no prior experience traveling to and around Ithaca. She emphasized the importance of researching all possible travel options, as they are often limited, especially when time is short. Planning ahead for both time and expenses is crucial; for example, buses are usually cheaper but take more time, while planes are faster but much more expensive. When asked about getting around Ithaca, she mentioned a preference for walking. Despite the availability of the TCAT bus service, she found it sometimes unreliable due to weather conditions, making walking a more dependable option for her.
