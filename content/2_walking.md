Tips for Walking in Ithaca
- Ensure you have good walking shoes, especially if you plan to explore trails with uneven terrain.
- Carry a water bottle, particularly during the warmer months.
- Ithaca weather can be unpredictable, so dress in layers and carry a rain jacket if necessary. We don't recommend walking long distances in the winter because of the snow and ice on the ground, and the extremely harsh weather. 
- Stick to well-lit paths if walking at night, and be aware of your surroundings.
