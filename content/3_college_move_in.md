## Moving in/out of Cornell or Ithaca College?
During move in week, new students often find themselves driving back and forth between their dorms, Target, Wegmans, and any other necessary stores to make sure they are comfortable in their new home. Below we provide several suggestions for those that don't have their own car to get to/from Ithaca.

## Arriving from Ithaca or Syracuse airport?
If you are arriving from Ithaca airport, we do **NOT** recommend Ubering as this usually can cost over $40! If you are living in a dorm on campus with available dining halls, we recommend you to take the TCAT bus which runs daily to or near the airport but make sure to double check the apps recommended on the TCAT page to get updated schedules in advance. 

If you are living off campus and are over 21, we recommend booking a rental car at the airport you arrive at as this will provide you with more convenience when driving back and forth between your apartment and stores. Please see potential car rental options on the Flying To/From Ithaca page.

## Arriving at a different airport?
In this case, a bus from a big city may not be the most ideal option, however, this seems to be the best option if you are under 21 based on the prices. Just make sure to book your ticket in advance! Check out the Buses page for more information.

If you are 21 years or older, we recommend booking a rental car at the airport you arrive at assuming you are on the east coast. Please check the Flying To/From Ithaca page for potential car rental options.

## Not Flying but on the East Coast?
We recommend you to take a bus as they are more frequent near move-in week and travel from several different destinations along the east coast. Please see the Buses page for more information.
