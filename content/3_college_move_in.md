> **Move In Travel?**
During move in week, new students often find themselves driving back and forth between their dorms, Target, Wegmans, and any other necessary stores to make sure they are comfortable in their new home. In this case, a bus from a big city may not be the most ideal option. Thus, we recommend booking a rental car at whichever aiport you arrive in.
