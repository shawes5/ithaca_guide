If you live in New York or one of the bordering states, the easiest and typically cheapest way to reach Ithaca is by car. However, this luxury is not afforded to many students due to proximity. Depending on where you are coming from, there are various bus and airplane options to reach Ithaca. Most out-of-state students who live in far states, as well as international students, elect to fly to Ithaca via one of the nearby airports for shorter breaks unless long road trips are your thing. To move in and move out, depending on who you ask, some out-of-state students may take those road trips to transport their personal belongings.
