## Buses

If you don't have a car, you're in luck! There are several buses available to get around Ithaca. However, keep in mind they might not be 100% reliable when there is construction, bad weather (any kind of rain/snow), or any other unexpected events. Buses may get especially crowded in the winter when students are looking to avoid the snowy walks to class, and you may not get a seat.

## Biking (maybe make this a new page)
> If you don't already have your own, renting a bike in Ithaca, New York, offers numerous benefits. It allows you to explore the city's scenic beauty, including gorges, waterfalls, and lakes, at your own pace. Biking is an eco-friendly and cost-effective mode of transportation that also provides significant health benefits. Ithaca is bike-friendly, with many trails and routes like the Cayuga Waterfront Trail and South Hill Recreation Way. Renting a bike is convenient and helps you avoid parking hassles, especially downtown. It also fosters community engagement through biking events and tours, making it an enjoyable and practical way to experience Ithaca.
> However, you may encounter some pretty steep hills traveling up and down from Cornell's campus to the Commons.
