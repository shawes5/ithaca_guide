## Buses

If you don't have a car, you're in luck! There are several buses available to get around Ithaca. However, keep in mind they might not be 100% reliable when there is construction. 

> **[Tompkins Consolidated Area Transit (TCAT)](https://tcatbus.com/)**
> 
> The TCAT bus system is popular amongst Cornell and Ithaca College students, faculty, and staff to get to different buildings on campus and to visit shopping centers outside of campus.
