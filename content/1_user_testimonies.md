## Their Thoughs
**Chloe O. (Cornell MBA & MILR):**

“Before coming to Cornell, I wish I had gotten a heads up that travel would be tedious. It’s a lot of DIY, you either have to ask people for their advice or look for it online. For me it was a lot of trial and error to see what worked and what didn’t. Having clarity on all of the options would have been great.”


**Tanya M. (Cornell CoE):**

"Though I live within four hours driving distance from Cornell, I really struggled figuring out the best ways to get home for break in my first two years. Having an extensive guide like this during these times would have completely taken the stress out of school breaks."


**John H. (Cornell ILR)**:

"Having grown up in Europe, it isn't feasible for me to fly home for the shorter breaks in October in February, and I would spend these long weekends in Ithaca. This guide has not only opened my eyes to the ease of traveling to New York City or Boston for a weekend, but also expands the opportunities to explore around Ithaca."
