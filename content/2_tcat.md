## Buses

If you don't have a car, you're in luck! There are several buses available to get around Ithaca. However, keep in mind they might not be 100% reliable when there is construction, bad weather (any kind of rain/snow), or any other unexpected events. Buses may get especially crowded in the winter when students are looking to avoid the snowy walks to class, and you may not get a seat.

> The TCAT bus system is popular amongst Cornell and Ithaca College students, faculty, and staff to get to different buildings on campus and to visit shopping centers outside of campus.
