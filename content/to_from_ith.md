## Flying to Ithaca?
Not a problem! Below is an extensive guide on how to best get to Ithaca, with a combination of cars/buses/rental cars.  

> **Move In Travel?**
During move in week, new students often find themselves driving back and forth between their dorms, Target, Wegmans, and any other necessary stores to make sure they are comfortable in their new home. In this case, a bus from a big city may not be the most ideal option. Thus, we recommend booking a rental car at whichever aiport you arrive in. 


## Airports
Make sure to book flights at least a couple months in advance, especially if arriving near move-in dates for [Cornell](https://scl.cornell.edu/residential-life/housing/housing-details/moving-campus)
 and [Ithaca College](https://www.ithaca.edu/office-residential-life/living-campus/move)students (August 19-25). Ithaca and Syracuse Airports are the closest options.
