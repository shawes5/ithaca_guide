New Cornell and Ithaca College (IC) students, faculty, and staff as well as newcomers to the Ithaca community need to know what transportation facilities in Ithaca are available to them to effectively navigate within or to or from the small, semi-isolated city, saving them time, money, and the stress of planning.

This comprehensive transportation guide aims to teach fellow Ithacans the best ways to utilize available transportation facilities by providing the available transportation facilities all in one website!

We hope you utilize this website to make your travel planning as smooth and straight forward as possible.

## Authors
We are a team of 3 Cornell undergraduates who were surprised at the lack of resources available to easily and efficiently determine transportation facilities to get to/from Ithaca as well as navigating within Ithaca. As rising junior and seniors, we want to share information that we learned based on our own experiences as well as from others. If you're new to Ithaca, it can be quite a challenge figuring this out on your own.
