      <description>Buses If you don&amp;rsquo;t have a car, you&amp;rsquo;re in luck! There are several buses available to get around Ithaca. However, keep in mind they might not be 100% reliable when there is construction, bad weather (any kind of rain/snow), or any other unexpected events. Buses may get especially crowded in the winter when students are looking to avoid the snowy walks to class, and you may not get a seat.</description>
