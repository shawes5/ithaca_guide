      <description>Move In Travel? During move in week, new students often find themselves driving back and forth between their dorms, Target, Wegmans, and any other necessary stores to make sure they are comfortable in their new home. In this case, a bus from a big city may not be the most ideal option. Thus, we recommend booking a rental car at whichever aiport you arrive in.</description>

      <description>If you live in New York or one of the bordering states, the easiest and typically cheapest way to reach Ithaca is by car. However, this luxury is not afforded to many students due to proximity. Depending on where you are coming from, there are various bus and airplane options to reach Ithaca. Most out-of-state students who live in far states, as well as international students, elect to fly to Ithaca via one of the nearby airports for shorter breaks unless long road trips are your thing.</description>

      <description>Their Thoughs Chloe O. (Cornell MBA &amp;amp; MILR):&#xA;“Before coming to Cornell, I wish I had gotten a heads up that travel would be tedious. It’s a lot of DIY, you either have to ask people for their advice or look for it online. For me it was a lot of trial and error to see what worked and what didn’t. Having clarity on all of the options would have been great.</description>

      <description>Buses If you don&amp;rsquo;t have a car, you&amp;rsquo;re in luck! There are several buses available to get around Ithaca. However, keep in mind they might not be 100% reliable when there is construction, bad weather (any kind of rain/snow), or any other unexpected events. Buses may get especially crowded in the winter when students are looking to avoid the snowy walks to class, and you may not get a seat.</description>
