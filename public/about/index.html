<p>We are a team of 3 Cornell undergraduates who were surprised at the lack of resources available to easily and efficiently determine transportation facilities to get to/from Ithaca as well as navigating within Ithaca. As rising junior and seniors, we want to share information that we learned based on our own experiences as well as from others. If you&rsquo;re new to Ithaca, it can be quite a challenge figuring this out on your own.</p>
